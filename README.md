**NotebookLM Fixer** is an intelligent tool specifically designed to repair PDF documents generated by [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/). Utilizing Google's latest **Gemini 3.0 Pro** multimodal model, it addresses common issues such as blurred text, artifacts, and low resolution in documents. It achieves pixel-level image restoration and supports exporting to high-definition PDF or editable PPTX presentations.

## ✨ Core Features

> **🔥 New in v1.1**
> - **Enhanced Text Repair**: Significantly improved recognition and restoration rate for Chinese characters (especially blurry fonts).
> - **Context Awareness**: Introduced context-based guessing to intelligently correct "look-alike" character errors.

- **🖼️ Intelligent HD Restoration**: Uses the `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` model to intelligently recognize and redraw document content, rather than just applying a filter.

- **🔍 Pixel-level Repair**: Offers **2K (Standard)** and **4K (Extreme)** resolution options to meet different needs.
- **📝 Precise Text Restoration**: Fixes jagged edges and blurry text while maintaining the original layout (*Note: Improves quality only, does not alter content*).
- **📊 Multi-format Export**:
  - **PDF**: Regenerated vector-like clear documents.
  - **PPTX**: Also supports exporting to PPTX format (Note: Content within PPTX is image-based and not editable text).
- **🌗 Modern User Experience**:
  - Supports **Dark/Light Mode** switching.
  - Supports **English/Chinese** bilingual interface.
  - **Real-time Comparison**: Long-press or click to compare quality before and after restoration.
  - **Mouse Follow Effects**: Immersive visual experience.
