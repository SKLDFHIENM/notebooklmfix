## ✨ Core Features

> **📱 v2.4.0 Mobile Experience Polish**
> - **UI Adaptation & Fixes**:
>   - **Slim Modals**: Significantly reduced margins for announcement and top-up modals on small screens, ensuring content is scrollable and not obstructed.
>   - **Layout Fixes**: Resolved overlap issues between the bottom action bar and image checkboxes, and fixed the truncated archive tooltip on mobile.
>   - **Overflow Protection**: "Completion Banner" buttons now hide text labels on mobile to prevent screen overflow. Archive box buttons are forced to single-line display.
> - **Core Stability (OOM Fix)**: Refactored the mobile image viewer to a lightweight version (`<img>` + gesture library) and defaults to 2K resolution to prevent browser crashes (OOM).
>
> **🎉 v2.3.0 Credit System Update**
> - **Unified Credit System**: Transitioned from "usage count" to a flexible "Credit" system.
>   - **2K Standard**: Consumes **1 Credit**.
>   - **4K Ultra**: Consumes **2 Credits**.
> - **Seamless Migration**: No action needed for existing users. Your remaining quota will be automatically doubled (**x2**) and converted to credits upon your first visit (e.g., 10 Times -> 20 Credits).
> - **Rolling UI**: Added smooth rolling number animations and service upgrade notifications.
>
> **🚀 v2.2.3 Prompt Refined**
> - **Enhanced Text Accuracy**: Underlying prompts have been optimized to use context (paragraphs, sentences) to infer blurred text, significantly reducing hallucinations and typos.
> - **Stricter Layout Control**: Strengthened constraints on "composition, color distribution, and UI layout" to ensure the restored image is visually consistent with the original, preventing structural restructuring.
>
> **🚀 New in v2.2.2 (UX Polish)**
> - **Quota Safe Mode**:
>   - **Smart Alerts**: Dual feedback via **Toast** & **Tooltip** when errors occur, explicitly confirming "No Credits Deducted".
>   - **Safe Fail**: Network errors are automatically intercepted to protect your collected credits.
> - **Auto 4K**: "Access Code Mode" now automatically locks resolution to **4K Ultra**, ensuring the best experience by default.
> - **Disclaimer Restored**: A prominent new Disclaimer section added to the footer to clarify service rules and billing logic.
>

## ⚠️ Disclaimer & Policy

> **Please read before use**

1.  **AI Limitations**: This tool uses Generative AI (GenAI) for image upscaling and restoration. While generally effective, it is **not 100% perfect**. For original text that is **extremely small, blurry, or illegible**, the AI may fail to recognize it or produce "hallucinations" (incorrect guesses). Please understand these technical limitations.
2.  **Quota & Refund**:
    *   **Deduction**: Credits are deducted only when a page is **successfully restored**.
    *   **Refund**: If restoration fails due to network, AI errors, or server faults, the system will **automatically roll back**. Your credits will **not be consumed** for failed attempts.
