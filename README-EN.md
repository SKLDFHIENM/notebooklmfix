> **🚀 v2.2.3 Prompt Refined**
> - **Enhanced Text Accuracy**: Underlying prompts have been optimized to use context (paragraphs, sentences) to infer blurred text, significantly reducing hallucinations and typos.
> - **Stricter Layout Control**: Strengthened constraints on "composition, color distribution, and UI layout" to ensure the restored image is visually consistent with the original, preventing structural restructuring.
>

>
> **🚀 New in v2.2**
> - **📦 Local Archive Box**: Automatically saves your generated high-res original images. Your history is preserved even after refreshing the page. Data is stored locally for privacy and security.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer & Policy

> **Please read before use**

1.  **AI Limitations**: This tool uses Generative AI (GenAI) for image upscaling and restoration. While generally effective, it is **not 100% perfect**. For original text that is **extremely small, blurry, or illegible**, the AI may fail to recognize it or produce "hallucinations" (incorrect guesses). Please understand these technical limitations.
2.  **Quota & Refund**:
    *   **Deduction**: Credits are deducted only when a page is **successfully restored**.
    *   **Refund**: If restoration fails due to network, AI errors, or server faults, the system will **automatically roll back**. Your credits will **not be consumed** for failed attempts.
